Make a gem pickup icon: `assets/ui/gem.png`, 16x16 pixels, only the colors in `inputs/palette.hex`, on a transparent background. Record it in the manifest.

Project layout (the same in every brief): the engine imports from `assets/`. Put exports in `assets/`, editable masters in `masters/`, rebuild
scripts in `tools/` (a script is run from the project root), and the manifest at `assets/MANIFEST.json` (see `skills/studio/manifest.schema.json`). Inputs are in `inputs/` and are read-only.
